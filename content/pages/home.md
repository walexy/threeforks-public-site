Zs Café is using the Trinity Forks platform to track the growing food insecurity problem, recruit volunteers, and organize food delivery. They are great people doing great things &mdash; one vision to feed Tarrant county with our abundant resources and talents.

Trinity Forks wants to help Zs Café and its partners to do the purpose-driven work they were called to do. They recruit volunteers, promote the cause, produce thousands of robust and healthy meals, and deliver it. Our application tracks the need, the facilities, and volunteers. It matches the need to the skills and resources required to feed 500,000 hungry people. 

As the platform grows, non-profit organizations will be able to coordinate cooperative efforts and share responsibility. Together, they are managing the acute problem of food insecurity. As their work evolves, they will sustain the effort by reducing chronic food hunger.

Trinity Forks provides an essential tool to help organizations across Tarrant county, the largest county in the country, to lead the way, reduce overlapping work, and coordinate with each other.
